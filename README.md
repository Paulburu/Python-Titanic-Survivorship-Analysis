# Python-Titanic-Survivorship-Analysis

In this repository I practiced by exploring data cleaning, data organizing, data changing, and data analyzing methods. 
The dataset used is taken from kaggle and contains Titanic information.
The goal of this analysis was to find a model that best predicts the odds of survival for an individual on titanic based on the available information.
